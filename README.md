# Machine Learning Projects and Assignments Repository

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects and assignments completed during my diploma at AMIT Learning two years ago. It showcases my journey and progress in understanding fundamental and advanced concepts in machine learning, using Python and various popular libraries.

## Repository Structure

- **Assignments**: Jupyter notebooks with various assignments focused on theoretical and practical applications of machine learning algorithms.
  - `Assignment 1.ipynb`
  - `Assignment 2.ipynb`
  - `Assignment 3.ipynb`
  - `Assignment_4.ipynb`
  
- **Projects**: Mid-sized projects demonstrating specific use cases and real-world applications.
  - `mid-project/`
  - `min project(2)/`
  - `project/`

- **AMIT Projects**: Final projects completed as part of the AMIT Learning diploma, showcasing end-to-end model development, evaluation, and deployment.
  - `amit_project_1_Bank_Dataset_RF.ipynb`
  - `amit_project_2.ipynb`
  - `amit_project_2_phishing.ipynb`

- **Additional Notebooks**: Notebooks that explore specific datasets or topics.
  - `Drugs200.ipynb` - Drug classification task using Random Forests.
  - `answer_titanic.ipynb` - Titanic dataset analysis and model prediction.

- **Documentation**: Documentation files related to the assignments and projects.
  - `Task.docx`
  - `README.md` - This README file.

## Key Highlights

- **Core Topics Covered**: 
  - Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualization.
  - Classification, regression, clustering, and ensemble methods.
  - Model evaluation techniques including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Hyperparameter tuning, model optimization, and validation.

- **Tools and Libraries Used**:
  - **Python**: Core programming language used for assignments and projects.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and visualizations.
  - **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**: For data manipulation, model training, and visualization.
  - **Colaboratory**: Some projects were developed using Google Colab for ease of collaboration and GPU support.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
